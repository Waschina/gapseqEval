# Bacterial gene essentiality

#### Gene essentiality predictions

Comparison of the predicted gene essentialities for curatedmods and reconstructions from carveme, modelseed, and gapseq for five bacterial species (*E. coli*, *B. subtilis*, *P. aeruginosa*, *S. oneidensis*, *M. genitalium*). The comparison is performed with the R-code stored in `compare_GE_recons.R`.



#### Comparison of GPR-strings

Reference: E. coli iML1515

See R-code `gpr_ecoli_analysis.R`. Two GPR-strings are compared in the way that <u>all</u> logical combination (TRUE = gene present, FALSE = gene knockout) of the genes involved in the GPR result in the same boolean output.
